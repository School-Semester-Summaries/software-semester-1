# Preface
In this semester you start off with 5 subjects for 20 weeks. Since I've already passed these subjects in [Semester 1 Media](https://github.com/CrossyChainsaw/School-Semester-Summaries/tree/master/Semester%201%20-%20Media) I could skip them this time and start focussing on Software.
 
After the 20 weeks when you start to focus on Software, you make exercises to prove you understand the following terms: Variables, conditional statements, loops, methods, lists/ arrays and enumâ€™s. Also did we have to ask and apply feedback regularly. As last it it important to show that you can solve problems using flowcharts.

## Learning outcomes with *
Underneath a product I sum up what learning outcomes I touched with the corresponding exercise. If you see a asterisk (*) in the list of learning outcomes, then its something I did extra that semester that wasn't required to pass the semester

# Products
Here I'll cover all products I made and what it made me practise. A lot of the products might be inspried from this [exercise page provided by school](https://stasemsoft.github.io/softwarematerial/docs/objects/). The page gets changed once in a while so if you can't find any similar exercises they probably removed them.

We will go in order from favourite/coolest products to least favourite/cool. If a project wasn't mentioned I couldn't be bothered to write about it.

## DinoGame
DinoGame was an exercise that was in the toolbox with exercises. With this exercise i practised the following,
- keypresses*
- play music*

### What were you suposed to make
You were suposed to make a 'game' wherein there are 2 playable characters. The goal is to get the coin. If you click on the left 'Activeer' button, you can controll the left dino, and if you click on the right button you control the right one. The dino has to be controller by buttons on your keyboard. I found this idea extremely lame since its not even a game.

### What did I make
I made a game wherein 2 players actually play against each other. its the concept of DinoGame but turned into a realtime 1v1 game.

So here you see a Red and a Blue player both on a grid (the dinos). Also can you see a lila block (the coin). and as an extra functionality you see dark red blocks. these are Player 2 his walls. Both players can place walls on the grid to block the opponents path. Player 2 himself can pass trough his own walls but not through player 1 his walls. 

### Coin Spawn Logic
I tried to make the spawn logic of the coin fair so that it doesn't have the chance to spawn right next to a player. Watch the video for an explanation.

This project has its own repository -> [DinoGame Repository](https://github.com/CrossyChainsaw2/DinoGame)

## RPG
RPG is the last exercise I made this semester to prove my teacher I understood evertything,
- objects/ classes
- encapsulation
- overloading
- class diagrams
- custom parameter/return
- seperating GUI en Domain
- keyspresses*

### What is RPG
RPG is, as the name says, an RPG game. It started as a normal applciation wherein I would touch some learning outcomes, but in the end it became a meme with amongus characters.

### Gameplay
The cool thing about RPG is that you can have multiple endings. Here is 1 examples (I think there are 3 or 4 different endings).

## BattleSim
Battle simulator, kinda like a pokemon battle. 
- objects/ classes
- seperating GUI en Domain

This project has its own repository -> [BattleSim Repository](https://github.com/CrossyChainsaw/BattleSim)

## TetrisAttack
As short as possible. This project is my version of the game Pokemon Puzzle League. But it's made in WinForms and I only made singleplayer. Here's a short video of the program (the latest version is bugged and I didn't work on it anymore)

## Lingo
Lingo is a gameshow on dutch television. I made this into a program. Here's a screenshot,
- Read out a textfile (using it as data)

## Galgje
Learning outcomes I touched with this exercise,
- objects/classes
- constructors
- encapsulation
- overloading
- seperating GUI and Domain

### What is Galgje
Galgje is the dutch word for Hangman. The application is a game of hangman where it randomly picks a word from a set list of a few words. Nothing too special.

# Projects
our group project is called PlayAcademy, a project wherein we educate students using gamification.
